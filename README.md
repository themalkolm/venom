# venom [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/themalkolm/venom.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/themalkolm/venom)

Add some venom to make [cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) and [viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper)
even more dangerous!

## Usage

See `example/` folder for an example how to use venom. You can also use it as a skeletop for
any 12-factor app you plan to use. It won't solve all problems but it will take care to solve
the [config](https://12factor.net/config) one.
